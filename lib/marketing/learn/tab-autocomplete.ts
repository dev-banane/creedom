    "Tab is Creed's in-editor autocomplete. Put your cursor anywhere in a section, press Tab once, and a suggestion streams in as ghost text: the rest of the sentence, written in your voice, drawn from everything else in your file. Press Tab again to accept it, press Escape to dismiss it, or just keep typing and it gets out of your way.\n\nIt is not the per-keystroke prediction you know from code editors. Tab only runs when you ask, it completes one thought at a time, and it never invents facts about you. It can only recombine and extend what is already in your file or clearly implied by what you just typed. If it does not know your deploy tooling, it writes up to the gap and stops rather than guessing.\n\nThat design means Tab compounds. With one thin section, it can only offer structure. With a full file, it completes a Preferences line with your actual tools, your actual constraints, your actual people, because it read them in your other sections. The sharper your Creed, the sharper Tab writes.",
