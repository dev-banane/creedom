  "25-49: poor. Mostly placeholders, vague self-description, or empty scaffolding. AI gets little reliable signal about the user.",

  "Work: profession, craft, tools/stack, and how the user likes to work. Real surfaces and methods.",
  "Preferences: specific reply-style defaults with concrete do/avoid signal. Not generic 'be helpful'.",
  "Constraints: explicit lines AI should not cross - hard noes, sensitive topics, things that need permission.",
  "People: named relationships, role, why they matter, what AI should remember when they come up.",
  "Health: conditions, sensitivities, dietary patterns, accessibility needs - paired with how AI should accommodate them.",
